## Solution
- This was designed so it was solvable by ICS students that learned `Bubble sort` in their day class.
- The intended solution was to bubble sort the 3 values separtely, then place all necessary possible permutations (27, as we only need the top 3 from each value) into one final array, and bubble sort the final array.
- It seems that alot of students were having trouble with this problem as they placed all possible permuations, which was 1000 x 1000 x 1000 numbers into one array, which caused a memory overflow.
