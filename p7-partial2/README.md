## Solution
- For this subtask, an LIS was required. Its simply a choosing this letter as part of the Longest-increasing subsequence, or not choosing it.
- For this, you needed to use dynamic programming, which keeps the already calculated value in a easily accessible place, which brought down the naive brute-force lis to the semi-optimized lis, which has a time complexity of O(N<sup>2</sup>)
- Time complexity: O(N<sup>2</sup>).
