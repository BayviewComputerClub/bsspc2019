{\Large BSSPC â€˜19 P4 - Katyusha!}
\\\\
\textbf{\large Problem Statement}
\par
It is the year $1945$. You are a Soviet \textit{Super-Soldier} and can predict the future. You have just completed a mission to sabotage the dying capital of the Third Reich. You need to safely return to your \textit{comrades }advancing on the outskirts of Berlin.

\par
However, there are several \textbf{Katyusha} units that are currently firing on the area between you and your comrades. There are three types of \textbf{Katyushas}: the light \textit{BM-8}, with an impact radius of $8$ meters, the intermediate \textit{BM-13}, with an impact radius of $13$ meters, and the massive \textit{BM-30}, with an impact radius of a whopping $30$ meters. Comrade Super-Soldier, you need to determine whether you can return to your comrades and complete the final assault in the Great Patriotic War!

\par
There will be a grid of $101$ by $101$ squares. Each of the $N$ \textbf{Katyusha} units will turn a square at $(x,y)$ into a death-zone (\textbf{DZ}). You start from the bottom left corner (square $(0,0)$) of the grid and must reach the top right corner (square $(100,100)$) of the grid without entering any \textbf{DZ}. You may travel in any direction laterally, but may not travel diagonally. Good luck, \textit{comrade}!

\textbf{\large Input Specification}
\par
The first line will contain one integer, $0 \le N \le 5000$. Each of the next $N$ lines will contain $2$ space-separated integers, $0 \le x_i \le 100$ and $0 \le y_i \le 100$.

\textbf{\large Output Specification}
\par
You will print a single character, $y$ to indicate that you can reach your comrades or $n$ to indicate that you will die for the motherland.
