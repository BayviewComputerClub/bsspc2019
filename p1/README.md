## Solution
- This was meant to be a trivial problem that all ICS students should be able to complete, it only requires 1 simple if / else statement.

- ```java
  // assuming a is the first number, b is the second number and c is the answer.
  if(a * b == c){
    System.out.println("AC");
  } else {
    System.out.println("WA");
  }
  ```
 
 - **Time Complexity: O ( 1 )**.
