{\Large BSSPC ‘19 P1 - Complex Contest Judging}
\\\\
\textbf{\large Problem Statement}
\par
Mr. A just spent the last month working on a judge for the Complex Judging Programming Contest. It was all going great, until he realized he forgot to write the grader server!

\par
Thankfully, this contest (for whatever reason...) only has 1 problem, A times B. Since Mr. A has just about had it after writing all this PHP for the judge, help him by creating a simple grader server!

\textbf{\large Input Specification}
\par
The first line will contain the space-separated integers $a$ and $b$ ($1 \le a, b \le 100$), which is the test case (numbers to multiply).

The second line will contain the integer $c$, which is the user’s program’s output.

\textbf{\large Output Specification}
\par
Output on one line AC if the user’s program’s output was correct, and WA if the output was wrong.
