## Solution
- This problem was meant to be for our senior level programmers, although, it is a bit too hard this year. 
- This is the classical tree-dp problem, where involves around either picking the node or not, and just dfs + dp the whole tree. 
- Interesting fact that since this was suppposed to be a rooted tree, other ways such as LCA were also possible.
