## Solution
- The intended solution was to use a `difference array`, but apparently test-data was weak and people managed to pass with the brute-force method was fast-input.
- How a difference-array works is explained here the difference array is explained here: [Difference Array]().
- With these data structures, the problem becomes easy. Now we can update the values in `O(1)` time,  making our time complexity to just **`O(N + Q)`**.
- Once again, a 64-bit integer is needed for this problem.
