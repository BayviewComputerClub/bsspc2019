## Solution
- This problem was meant to be solved by all ICS students. 
- The general idea is to first create an 2D array with all spaces, then putting the characters at the specified indexes.
- A catch for this problem is that the input is in the from `x` and `y`, which needs to be reversed when putting the characters in the 2D array.
