## Solution
- The intended solution was bit-mask dp, as I'm not too confident in my explanation skills, read up on bitmask here: [Bitmasks](https://github.com/BayviewComputerClub/CP-Algorithms/tree/master/Dynamic%20Programming/Bit%20Mask), and look at the solution, to understand how to solve it.
- This problem was a bit too hard for our school's level. 
- Time complexity: O(2<sup>2</sup>)
